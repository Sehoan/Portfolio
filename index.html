            <h4><a href="">Education 🎓</a></h4>
            <p>Currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science 
            (December 2022 graduation date)</p>
            <p>3rd year CS student at the University of Virginia, with a passion in
            learning new things everyday by "doing" and applying my knowledge to 
            create business value</p>

            <h4><a href="">📚 Journey | Experience</a></h4>
            <p> During my first year and a half at UVA, I've worked as an 
            undergraduate teaching assistant for two core CS classes, helping students
            understand data structures & algorithms in C++ and Java during weekly 
            office hours. Then, I started serving in the South Korean military, and 
            during that time, I began learning MERN tech stack to create a web product
            that can influence a larger audience. Since the end of my service, I've 
            worked as an SWE intern at Fasoo, a data security company, where I 
            collaborated with the cloud development team to add document's thumbnail 
            viewer functionality into the company's cloud platform, Wrapsody eCo. 
            Besides that, my partners from Georgia Tech and I founded a company, 
            choiXe, and built its <a href="http://www.choixe.app">website</a>, that helps stock 
            newbies effortlessly understand the market and make the reasonable, 
            well-informed choices. Currently, I am working as a software engineer at 
            <a href="http://www.glimmr.io">Glimmr</a>, where I have mostly worked on the 
            client-side of the website and just begun working on building its 
            administrative portal from scratch.</p>

              <a href="pages/skills.html">Skills 💻</a>
            </h4>
            <p> As for my future, I’m hoping to work either as a full stack engineer
            or cloud engineer. I love watching my work bringing an impact to end users
            and, on the other side, understanding the inner-working of the developer 
            tools to support the development process.</p>

            <p> In my free time, you will find me humming while listening to jazz or 
            petting my dog while watching a movie</p>
            <p>💪 Team Player, Positive Mindset, Public Speaking, Persistence, 
            Constant Learner</p>
