          <h4><a href="">📚 Journey | Experience</a></h4>
          <p> During my first year and a half at UVA, I've worked as an 
          undergraduate teaching assistant for two core CS classes, helping students
          understand data structures & algorithms in C++ and Java during weekly 
          office hours. Then, I started serving in the South Korean military, and 
          during that time, I began learning MERN tech stack to create a web product
          that can influence a larger audience. Since the end of my service, I've 
          worked as an SWE intern at Fasoo, a data security company, where I 
          collaborated with the cloud development team to add document's thumbnail 
          viewer functionality into the company's cloud platform, Wrapsody eCo. 
          Besides that, my partners from Georgia Tech and I founded a company, 
          choiXe, and built its <a href="http://www.choixe.app">website</a>, that helps stock 
          newbies effortlessly understand the market and make the reasonable, 
          well-informed choices. Currently, I am working as a software engineer at 
          <a href="http://www.glimmr.io">Glimmr</a>, where I have mostly worked on the 
          client-side of the website and just begun working on building its 
          administrative portal from scratch.</p>

            <a href="pages/skills.html">Skills 💻</a>
          </h4>
          <p> As for my future, I’m hoping to work either as a full stack engineer
          or cloud engineer. I love watching my work bringing an impact to end users
          and, on the other side, understanding the inner-working of the developer 
          tools to support the development process.</p>
